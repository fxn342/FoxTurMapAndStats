# FoxTurMapAndStats

This is a fan made project and is not associated with Turing Smart Screens or Siege Camp's Foxhole in any official manner. Use at your own risk.

This project utilizes the turing-smart-screen-python library and Foxhole War API to display current world conquest war information. Each screen will display for X number of seconds based on the INI configuration parameters. This project was built specifically for the 3.5" inch screen but the INI file and graphics can be modified to work with larger screens.

Known Issues:
        <br />
        The LCD screen can lock up depending on the timing of the screen draw. If the screen is drawing when the application is closed its possible the LCD will be stuck. Undocking/Unpluggin the LCD screen resolves the issue.
        <br />
        Its possible in some cases if a computer shutdown occurs the screen will not turn off.
